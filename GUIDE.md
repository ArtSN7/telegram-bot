Letâ€™s install library at first:

```python
pip install python-telegram-bot[ext] --upgrade

```

This library has really decent documentation ( **https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable )** . 

In addition, there are a number of example in their GIT-HUB ( https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/README.md ), by studying which you can understand how to use it correctly and what typical operations look like.

The **python-telegram-bot library version 20** is written using Asyncio , so it might be beneficial to understand how all of this works. ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html )
